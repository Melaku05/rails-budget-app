# Rails-budget-app
The Ruby on Rails capstone project is to build a mobile web application where I can manage my budget: I have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that I can see how much money I spent and on what. I will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to: register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
